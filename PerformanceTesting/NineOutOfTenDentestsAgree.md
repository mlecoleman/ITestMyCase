## Performance Testing Summary
I did my performance testing using JMeter, and I tested an end point provided by our friend reqres.in which is a website made to be tested.  I didn't show any errors, and the throughout was fairly consistent so I'd say the test was successul and the endpoint handeled the traffic well.  The Average line in the graph and the Deviation line started a little higher, and then reduced over time which may have been due to caching.
